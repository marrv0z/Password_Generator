# Password_Generator

This application is made to generate random passwords. In order to do so it consults the user what type of characters
they'd like in their password and the desired length of it. Once the user answers, it throws a password.

If the user would like to retrieve what they answered, they may always take a look at the conosole, where the 
number of characters and type of characters chosen is logged.

The application will generate as many passwords as wanted, all the user needs to do is keep on clicking the "Generate
Password" button, and the questions will pop up again.

P. S. It counts with letters A-Z in both lower and uppercase, all 10 number digits (0-9), and only 10 special characters.
